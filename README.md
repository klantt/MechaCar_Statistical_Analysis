# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

  In this weeks project I am working with an application called R and using ggplot2 to visualize the data with graphs. The data I will be analyzing with the automotive industry and certain aspects of it. The goal this week is to learn R and ggplot2 while formulating null and alternative hypothesis tests for a given problem. Lastly to use t-Tests, ANOVA, chi-squared test and A/B, A/A testing efficiently.
